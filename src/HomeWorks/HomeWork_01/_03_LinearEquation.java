/*
Use Cramerâ€™s rule to solve the following 2 * 2 system of linear equation:

ax + by = e         x = ((e * d) - (b * f)) / ((a * d) - (b * c))
cx + dy = f         Y = ((a * f) - (e * c)) / ((a * d) - (b * c))

Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y:

3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
2.1x + 0.55y = 5.9
