/*
A regular polygon is an n-sided polygon in which all sides are of the same length and all
angles have the same degree. The formula for computing the area of a regular polygon is:

area = (n âˆ— s^2) / (4 âˆ— Math.tan (Math.PI / n))

s is the length of a side. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of sides
and their length of a regular polygon and displays its area.
